# Checkout 51 Coding Challenge

# Why a take-home interview?

In-person coding interviews can be stressful and can hide some people's full potential. A take-home gives you a chance work in a less stressful environment and showcase your talent.

We want you to be at your best and most comfortable, just as you would be in our office environment

# Requirements

Given the json file “c51.json” create an application with one screen that turns it into a list. 

The file contains a list of offers and their attributes. Each row in the list must contain the offer name, its image and the cashback value in dollars. 

You can consume the list as file resource from the app or host it on a network using a simple service like “http://myjson.com/”. 

Feel free to build it in any way you want using any framework, architecture and tools at your disposal. Bonus points if you create a way for a user to sort the offers by name or cash back.

This is a relatively simple app, however we are looking for more than just the task to be completed.  At Checkout 51, we take the craftmanship of the code seriously, and want to see evidence that you do as well.  We are looking for software that is well structured, concise and testable.

**NOTE**: You are only required to build the front end application that's relevant to the job you are applying for.

## Android Specifics
Depending on your skills you can write in Java, Kotlin or a combination of both. Our app is approximately 60-70% Kotlin at this point.

## iOS Specifics
Our app was originally written in Objective-C and work has been done to port the codebase gradually over to Swift.  Feel free to write your solution in whatever language works best for you.

## Full-Stack Specifics
We're primarily a PHP shop and we take web application architecture seriously. We are looking for the following in the implementation.  
1. Understanding of MVC architecture
2. Dependency Injection
3. Repository pattern
4. Unit Testing
5. Documentation with an overview of your solution, including any instructions on how to run it.
6. Bonus points for setting up a working SQL database, populated with the provided JSON data, along with database deployment scripts
7. Double bonus points for a solution that does all of the above with minimal set up instructions. Ideally, we run one command from within your code base to deploy and run your app.
